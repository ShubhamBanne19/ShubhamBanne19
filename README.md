- Add **screenshots, gifs, or live demos** for every project (UI sells).  
- Update metrics regularly (**users served, speed gains, % improvements**).  
- Post short **tech notes/blogs** on GitHub Pages to showcase expertise.  
- Maintain visible GitHub activity (commits, PRs, code reviews). Consistency signals reliability.
